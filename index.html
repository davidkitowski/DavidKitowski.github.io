                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                This is my portfolio page that shows a bit more than what I have listed on my resume. I also have some personal projects that I've
                done over the course of time I spent in college. 
                <br>
                This webpage can hopefully serve as a showcase of some of the things I know or that I'm willing to learn.

                <ul>
                    <li>Python - Main language I've used for messing around with prototypes or whatever ideas I have.</li>
                    <li>Java - Fairly experienced with it. (OCA Java SE 8 certified (1Z-808))</li>
                    <li>C# - Less experience than with Java, but I've become comfortable with it.</li>
                    <li>PHP - Not heavily experienced with MVC concepts, I've worked on a class project that 
                        involved creating accounts and allowed for some basic things like submitting reviews from the user end.</li>
                    <li>SQL - Used for the same website project mentioned above.</li>

                Outside of coding as a hobby, I also really enjoy doing digital art. 
                My experience with 2D art is a little more extensive when compared to some 
                of the things I've done in 3D.

                <p class="caption">I made this one around 3 years ago.</p>
                In terms of 3D projects I don't have many things that I would consider
