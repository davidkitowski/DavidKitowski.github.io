For our finals for the last two quarters of my college, we were told to come up with a project idea that was either related to IT or programming.
After reviewing a few different ideas I decided on making a chess engine.
<br><br>
During the development of this whole thing I had three main things that were really challenging for me. The first hurdle I had to get over was 
that I had to do all of the researching and developing on my own, the second was debugging the engine itself, and the final one was performance, 
both in how fast the bot could generate moves and in the actual quality of the move being played.
<br><br>
Early on in the process of considering what I wanted for my chess engine I wanted to have it so that chess pieces could be combined, so for example 
a queen that can also do the moves of a knight. This difference made things a little more difficult since I can't take the same shortcuts that many other 
chess engines could easily take when keeping track of the state of pieces.





<br><br>
The biggest resource that helped me in getting started with the engine was the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page">Chess Programming Wiki</a>,
which had a ton of explanations for why certain things are done the way they are in most chess engines. One thing that gradually became hammered into my 
head when developing my engine was to always do a thorough test of any changes I made. Nearing the end of making this engine I made 
debugging features that helped in making testing much less tedious, such as loading board positions through FEN strings.
<br><br>
Once I had all of the chess rules implemented without any bugs remaining, I started on the actual bot part of the engine. This part 
is significantly more difficult to test since most of the tests aren't about easily discernible things like bugs. Most of the tests I 
had to do were mostly about figuring out whether or not the changes I made were making the bot play better or if it was able to find a move 
in less time.
<br><br>
For the last part of my final, I decided to try and give my chess engine a nicer looking interface, since prior I was using a text based one.

Instead of using an interface library I went with the Godot game engine instead. While I initially had some troubles with making sure 
that the whole game wouldn't freeze when the bot was deciding on a move the rest of the process wasn't too difficult. In the end I also 
got the combining features working as well. A fun side effect of the combining feature is that since I made it so that whenever a pawn promotes 
they lose any pieces they combined with, which means that if you combine your king with a pawn you could lose the game by promoting your king out of existance.
