<h1>Recreating images in various bizarre ways</h1>

    Around 2020, I found a website called <a href="http://linify.me/">linify.me</a>. The main feature of it was uploading an 
    image of your choice and watching it be slowly recreated using straight lines. While the idea was fun, 
    my main reasoning for recreating it was because I found a short discussion on how it could be replicated. 
    I challenged myself by only looking at the overview of how linifys image recreation worked, so no following 
    prexisting code examples!

    While I've lost the code for the recreation of linify, I do have some code for some of the offshoot ideas that I did after it. 
    One idea was to recreate the image with triangles instead.

    A lot of triangle based image recreations are usually using some form of a genetic algorithm. This approach usually means that 
    you are randomly adjusting the characteristics of each triangle until it more closely resembles the actual image. Since we are 
    dealing with randomness, recreating small details can take a massive amount of time.

    The big issue with this approach is that randomly stumbling your way into recreating an image is really slow. To make matters worse, most
    Python image libraries use the CPU for rendering shapes! 
    I later devised an approach that I haven't seen used elsewhere. The new idea was to draw a random line and to subdivide it anywhere 
    it detects a large change in color. With enough lines, you can usually get close enough that any mistakes made aren't that big of a deal.

    While this project was a bit arbitrary, I learned a lot throughout making it. I became a lot more familiar with Python libraries like 
    Pillow, PyGame, and Pyglet. I also became a lot more comfortable with digging through documentation since a lot of tutorials would usually lack 
    what I needed.
    <br><br>
    The primary reasoning for this project lasting for such a long time was that I worked on it during college breaks. Usually when I had time 
    I also had some new ideas on how I could improve things.
