    I initially made this website to show off some of my personal projects as a showcase of my coding experience. After spending some time 
    on this website however, it has also become a project in itself.

    Whenever I've made a website with fading animations and other fancy visuals I usually default to using JQuery. For this website I decided 
    to take a shot at implementing everything from scratch. My main reasoning for this is that I don't use JavaScript often, so it acts as 
    a way of getting used to it.

    The first thing I realized when making these common features from scratch is how much I took it for granted. I also became a lot 
    more comfortable with organizing the website in general. For each of these projects, they have their card information stored in a 
    JSON file and the actual article (like the one you are reading right now) is stored in a separate HTML file.

    <canvas id="backgroundDemo"></canvas>
    Outside of these features, I also wanted to include an animation in the background. At first I thought of doing a 3D effect with 
    squares that would shift while you scroll. Later on, I ended up with the effect you see in the background. I'm not particularly 
    experienced with the canvas element, but I think the effect is fairly nice. I created the illusion of depth by making each of the 
    floating characters have a distance value. With higher distance values the character becomes smaller, darker, and slower. On top 
    of this, I also made it shift slightly whenever you scroll.
