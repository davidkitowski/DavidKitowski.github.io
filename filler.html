    <h2>Explaining the aerodynamics of dogs</h2>
    Hello welcome to my ted talk where I discuss the aerodynamics of dogs. Can dogs fly? What methods can they use to fly? Are they hiding something from us? What are they hiding from us.
    Tell me now. Tell me.
    <br/>
    <h3>How aerodynamic are dogs?</h3>
    Obviously, dogs cannot fly. But what if they could? How well can they soar into the air before they plumet into the ground? Obviously, we can deduce this purely with intuition and
    absolutely no science whatsoever. Dogs are round, and many round things are aerodynamic. But this doesn't tell the full story, we also need wings to let them to glide in the air.
    The need for wings means that specific breeds of dog are not optimal for flight, since they have nothing to glide with. With this knowledge, we can deduce the optimal dog for flight.
    <br/><br/>
    Through thorough research, I have determined what breed of dog is optimal. I have even found the exact dog that is the MOST optimal for flight. I came to this conclusion by spending
    my precious minutes trawling through the internet, finding all the images I could. I even went further beyond than any other dog researcher and searched through the <i>deep web</i>,
    known as the most obscure part of the internet and where few researchers dare to set foot in.
    <h3>BEHOLD, THE OPTIMAL DOG</h3>

    Look at this dog. LOOK at this dog. Just through looking at it intuitively you can see all the tell tale signs of an aerodynamic dog. The ears, perfect for gliding. The roundness,
    just right for the aerodynamics. This dog could sustain a state of flight for a whole football field, no, what am I thinking, it could sustain flight for MILES. This dog could
    go around the earth and back 50x and it wouldn't plumet into the earth like a sad paper airplane. This dog would be indestructable unlike the hindenberg. This dog could last millenia.
    This dog will last forever, outliving every human who is born on earth this second.
    <br/><br/>
    This dog will become the 8th wonder of the world.

    <h2>The Incredible Feat: A Man's Triumph Over a Full-Grown Ant in One Hour (written by chatgpt)</h2>

    <h3>An introduction into an incredible story that shows the determination of mankind.</h3>

    In the annals of mankind's culinary conquests, there exist legends that push the boundaries of gastronomic exploration. Today, we delve into an enigma 
    that defies the very essence of plausibility - the extraordinary notion that a man could consume an entire, fully-grown ant within a mere hour. Buckle up, dear readers, 
    for this is no ordinary gastronomic pursuit; it is a journey of the senses and a triumph of the human spirit.

    <h3>The Intriguing Ant-Eating Challenge</h3>

    Picture, if you will, a man, equipped with an ironclad determination and an insatiable appetite for the bizarre. 
    In the realms of culinary audacity, this extraordinary individual stands tall, ready to face the mighty challenge of devouring a full-grown ant, as if it were a mere morsel.

    <h3>The Hour That Defies Time</h3>

    As the clock ticks away, our intrepid hero embarks on this monumental quest. 
    The notion of eating an ant in such a limited timeframe may seem implausible to the uninitiated, but with each passing second, this dauntless individual defies the very constraints of temporal reality.

    <h3>The Mind-Over-Ant Matter</h3>

    To accomplish this astonishing feat, our man taps into the untapped reservoirs of his mind, channeling a mental fortitude rarely witnessed in the annals of entomophagy. 
    One might question the logic behind such an endeavor, but the human spirit knows no boundaries, and the pursuit of extraordinary indulgence knows no reason.

    <h3>Chewing Away at Preconceptions</h3>

    As he chews, masticates, and savors this minuscule yet potent delicacy, the man showcases an unprecedented harmony of action and purpose. 
    His jaws move with unparalleled grace and conviction, like a well-choreographed symphony of culinary prowess.

    <h3>A Gastrointestinal Odyssey</h3>

    One must contemplate the arduous journey that this audacious ant meal embarks upon - traversing the man's digestive tract, navigating its way through a labyrinth of organs, 
    all within the confines of one hour. It's a journey that would make even the Greek epic poets green with envy.

    <h3>An Ode to the Indomitable Spirit</h3>

    In this herculean act of gastronomic defiance, our protagonist defies the very laws of nature. A man consuming an ant, fully-grown, no less, 
    within the confines of an hour is a testament to the indomitable spirit that resides within the human heart.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    While some may question the necessity or the logic behind such a seemingly implausible feat, it is undeniably a testament to the boundless potential of human determination. 
    We leave you, dear readers, with this thought-provoking tale of culinary audacity and invite you to ponder the depths of human capability. In this timeless saga of man versus ant, 
    we witness the relentless pursuit of extraordinary possibilities, demonstrating that when a man sets his mind to a task, he can achieve the unimaginable, 
    even if it involves consuming a full-grown ant within the span of a single hour. The name of the man who did this reality defying feat: <b>Antonius.</b>
